Dear Sir, Madam,

please find my below points on my redesign transforms the skip size selection experience from a basic, utilitarian page into a polished, user-centric interface that’s ready for today’s web standards and tomorrow’s users.

Why My Skip Size Selector Redesign Is a Major Improvement

1. Modern, Clean, and Responsive UI
The original skip size selection page at wewantwaste.co.uk is functional but visually dated, with a dense layout and limited responsiveness. My redesign introduces a modern, clean interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices. The use of whitespace, clear typography, and consistent color schemes makes the page feel more professional and user-friendly.

2. Mobile-First, Fully Responsive Design
Unlike the original, my version is fully responsive. The layout adapts seamlessly to any device, ensuring that users on mobile phones and tablets have just as smooth an experience as those on desktop. The sidebar navigation is hidden on larger screens and elegantly slides in on mobile/tablet, making navigation intuitive without cluttering the interface.

3. Enhanced User Experience (UX)
Hover Effects & Visual Feedback: Each skip card features interactive hover effects, providing immediate visual feedback and making the selection process more engaging.
Clear Call-to-Action: The “Select” button is prominent and easy to find, reducing user friction.
Night Mode Toggle: Users can switch to a night mode for comfortable viewing in low-light environments—a feature not present in the original.

4. Accessibility and Usability
Larger Click Targets: Buttons and interactive elements are sized for easy tapping on touch devices.
Semantic HTML & ARIA Labels: The code uses semantic elements and ARIA labels where appropriate, improving accessibility for screen readers.
Keyboard Navigation: The redesign supports keyboard navigation, making it more inclusive.

5. Separation of Concerns and Maintainable Code
Component-Based Architecture: The code is split into reusable React components (NightModeToggle, PopUpMSG, Sidebar), making it easy to maintain and extend.
Clean State Management: State is managed clearly and efficiently, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and ensuring a smooth user experience.

6. Performance and Data Handling
Dynamic Data Loading: The skip options are populated from a real API endpoint, ensuring the data is always up-to-date and reflecting real availability.
Optimized Images: Images are loaded efficiently, and the design ensures they scale well across devices.

7. Custom Features and Branding
Custom Sidebar: The sidebar navigation is unique to this redesign, providing quick access to other site sections without overwhelming the main content.
Branding Flexibility: The design can easily be adapted to match any brand’s color palette or style guide.

Hussein SALMAN
